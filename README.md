# emacs
## My Emacs config
Install by cloning the repo, and moving the .emacs.d and placing it in your home directory.

The skeleton of the config was provided by [this distribution](https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs), which has a very neat config.org-setup. 

Dependencies:
*	[Web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode)
*	[minizinc-mode](https://github.com/m00nlight/minizinc-mode)
